# Part 1

When creating an API, there are many _frameworks_ you can use, but they all essentially do the same thing. It's more important to learn the general paradigm rather than learn a specific framework. So just pick a framework and go with it. In this codelab we will use **express**, the **node.js** framework.

## Installing dependencies
You should already have **node.js** installed from the previous section, verify by running
```bash
node -v
```
If you get a version number back, you're good to go!

# Getting the necessary files
Clone this repository (or download the zip file). Move `models/` to some other directory. That directory will be your workspace.
