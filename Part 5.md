# Part 5 - Where to go from here

Congratulations! You've created a functional API! Things to do now:
* Come to our March 7 meeting over Front End web development with React/Redux and learn to make a front end for this app
* Add password hashing capability (HINT: look at [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs))
* Restrict users from accessing certain parts of the API unless they have a token (HINT: [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken))
